# Authentication

API consumers are authenticated on a service to service level using:

- [mutual TLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) to ensure trust on both
  the server and client side
- API keys to track and manage usage of the client

## Connect using mutual TLS

Using two-way authentication allows HMPPS to additionally verify the identity of a consumer before securely providing
any data. This means a certificate must be presented as part of making a request.

## Send an API key

To provide an API key, add an HTTP header called `x-api-key` with the value of the API key to the API request, ensuring
it's not encoded in Base 64. Without an API key, a `403 Forbidden` HTTP response is returned.
